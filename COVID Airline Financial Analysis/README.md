# Team-13
### AKA: Team Definitely Vibrant 十 三
Team 13's group project GitHub repository for MGT 6203 (Canvas) Fall 2022 semester. Investigation of correlations of three airline companies with quantities and types of delays at major US airports including airline financial data and consideration of COVID. This type of investigation will provide beneficial-operational insight to the airline industry and academia.

We investigate the relationships between delays and financeial performance. The hypothesis to be tested is that an increased delay count has a negative relationship to financial performance, most closely correlated with gross profit. Our findings are disseminated through a readable document, presentation slides and an accompanying youtube video.

## Notes on directory structure
Each member of our group contributed to a statistical model and the data, .Rmd, .R, and .html files for each can be found in the Final Code folder.

* Spencer -> Model 1: How do delays affect financial performance
* Eleibny -> Model 2: Linear regression analysis for gross profit
* Thuy -> Model 3: Delays impact on market cap
* Leland -> Model 4: Stock prices and airline delays

The directory folder structure is the same as the template from the class.
